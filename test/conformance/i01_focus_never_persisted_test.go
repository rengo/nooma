// TestI01_FocusIsNeverAPersistedStatus proves invariant I01
// (docs/02-cognitive-core.md §3): "being in focus" is a computed view over
// the pool — sort by effective priority, take the top N — never a stored
// status. status='focus' must never exist as a member of the unit status
// vocabulary.
//
// unit.Status and unit.AllStatuses (internal/core/unit) now exist —
// promoted into the untagged L2 suite by the same PR that added them
// (spec R7.1, design D8), per the ordering internal/core/unit/doc.go used
// to anchor before this test's promotion removed that paragraph.
//
// Two independent checks, mirroring docs/06-harness.md §4's own framing
// ("a test that fails if the literal 'focus' appears as a status value in
// the tree"):
//
//  1. Vocabulary: no member of unit.AllStatuses() is "focus".
//  2. Tree scan: no Go source file under internal/ or cmd/ assigns the
//     literal "focus" to something named Status. This is a coarse,
//     line-based heuristic (like i13_learning_signal_test.go's migration
//     scan), not a type-checked one — deliberately, so it needs no import
//     of go/ast to reason about a status literal it does not yet know the
//     shape of. Go source only: migrations are .sql files, embedded via
//     the go:embed directive, and are naturally outside this scan (design D1).
//
// Both checks apply design D10's non-empty-corpus guard: assert a non-empty
// corpus was found before asserting anything about its content, so a moved
// or renamed directory cannot turn this test vacuously green.
